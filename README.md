####Game of Life
This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life that runs in the terminal.

Usage: ./game_of_life [File] [Row Length]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[File]: Contains the starting grid. x means alive and . means dead.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Row Length]: The number of cells on each row.
    
I included several example inputs for the program, all of which can be found on the Game of Life's Wikipedia entry  
Usage:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diehard: ./game_of_life diehard.txt 31  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gosper Gun: ./game_of_life gosper_gun.txt 80  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pulsar: ./game_of_life pulsar.txt 15
